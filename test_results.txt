Conclusion:
================================================================================
The update_quote.py script uses random.choice() which CAN select from
ALL quotes in the list. However, quotes that appear more frequently
in the list have a higher probability of being selected.

With 1023 total quotes and 54 unique quotes,
each quote's selection probability is proportional to how many times
it appears in the list.
